## Business Problem
For retail businesses, if they know in advance how many units are going to be sold in the coming days, it can help them maximize their profits. This forecasting can be done using machine learning techniques.
The Makridakis Open Forecasting Center(MOFC) at the university of Nicosia conducts cutting-edge forecasting research and provides business forecast training. In the 5th iteration of competition hosted on Kaggle we have to predict unit sales of various products sold in the USA by Walmart for the forecasting horizon of 28 days using historic sales data.

## ML formulation of Business Problem
The given forecasting task can be posed as a machine learning task and solved using ML algorithms.
For this we will 1st need to re-frame data as supervised dataset and predict the units sold on a particular day using ML regression models.
